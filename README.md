# PenalizedBTPB
Penalized Bivariate Tensor Product B-Spline Code
This code is for the paper An Investigation of Actuarial Fair Crop Insurance Rates Using Partial Derivatives of Penalized Bivariate Tensor Product B-splines.

There are five R scripts in this project and two simulated data frames to show how the scripts and function work.  

The scripts are: 
FunctionsBTPS.R
GraphSetUp.R
SimulationSetUP.R
Workflow_Script.R
SmallWorkingExample.R

The data frames are:
one
two
